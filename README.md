# Usage

### Requirements
The solution is delivered as a Java JAR file.  It requires Java JRE 8+.  

### Running the solution
If your java executable is located in your path, you can run the solution from the command line.  The solution also requires an internet connection.

### Help menu & topics list
The following will display the help menu, along with a list of topics available to crawl:
`java -jar cochrane-library-crawler`

Example output:
```
usage: java -jar cochrane-crawler
 -h         Display this help information
 -o <arg>   [Required] - Output filename. [-o ./cochrane_reviews.txt]
 -t <arg>   [Required] - Input topic numbers to crawl.  Comma delimited.
            Use dash for ranges.  [-t 0-5,10,24]
Available topics....
0. Lungs & airways
1. Methodology
2. Mental health
//.... 30 lines ...//
33. Orthopaedics & trauma
34. Neonatal care
35. Cancer
```
### Crawling the Cochrane Library
To actually crawl the library, two arguments are required:
- `-o`: The output filename.  The output will be written to the file you specify here. (e.g. `-o ./cochrane_reviews.txt` will output to cochrane_reviews.txt in the current working directory.)
- -`t`: The topic numbers to crawl.  Refer to the help menu to determine which topic number maps to which topic.  (e.g. `-t 0` will crawl "Lungs & airways").  To crawl multiple topics, you can separate topic numbers with commas `-t 1,2,3`.  You can also specify ranges with a dash `-t 0-15`.


Example call:
`java -jar ./cochrane-library-crawler.jar -t 1,25-26,35 -o ./cochrane_reviews.txt`

Example command line output:
```
(Methodology) Progress:35/35
(Methodology) Finished:35/35
(Wounds) Progress:163/163
(Wounds) Finished:163/163
(Health professional education) Progress:2/2
